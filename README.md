This repository contains a non-exhaustive set of topics that I consider important for being a solid software engineer. I regularly use it as a study reference when preparing for technical interviews.

The content is primarily maintained as personal notes, not as a polished or authoritative public resource. If you happen to come across this repository, feel free to look around, but keep in mind that the material reflects personal summaries and interpretations and may be incomplete, opinionated, or occasionally inaccurate.

Scope

The focus is on backend, systems, and infrastructure topics commonly explored in mid-to-senior software engineering interviews:

operating systems and networking

concurrency and language runtimes

databases, caching, and distributed systems

containers, observability, and security basics

engineering workflow and selected domain knowledge (finance)

Notes aim to emphasize:

core mental models

trade-offs and constraints

common failure modes

typical interview questions

small, focused code examples
