### Clean Code

**Summary:**  
*Clean Code* emphasizes writing readable, maintainable software through meaningful names, small focused functions, clear abstractions, disciplined error handling, and strong testing practices. The goal is to minimize cognitive load and reduce long-term maintenance cost.

**Key Takeaways:**
1. Code is read far more than it is written
2. Use meaningful names
3. Functions should be small and do **one thing**
4. Avoid comments — make code explain itself
5. Error handling is part of the design
6. Follow the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
7. Understand the distinction between objects and data structures
8. Tests are first-class code
9. Formatting matters
