# Company Analysis

This folder contains **company-specific interview preparation notes**.

For each company, the goal is to quickly understand:
- What the company does
- How it makes money
- Its size, structure, and market
- Why it is relevant to my background

These notes are **not marketing summaries**.  
They are practical context to:
- Answer “What do you know about the company?”
- Adapt my experience to their domain
- Prepare relevant questions for interviews
