# Video Analysis

This folder contains my collection of **technical videos, conference talks, and tutorials**, primarily from YouTube.  
Each resource includes a **small summary and key points** to make it easier to revisit and extract value.

Videos are organized into **subfolders whenever possible** to group by topic, domain, or focus area (e.g., HFT, distributed systems, C++, networking).
